# hearth-logger

## Usage:

Put hearthlog.py in the \Hearthstone\Hearthstone_Data folder. Run the program, then start up Hearthstone. Start up a match and the gui should start displaying the cards you have in your hand as well as the cards you have played etc.

## Future plans:

This was designed to be the base of a neural network that guesses the opponents hand based on the cards they have played. I still intend to make that but I've been busy and I'll get around to it mostly when I figure out a good way to do it. In the mean time feel free to use it for your own purposes if you want. If you do end up using it credit me if you want but I'm not too fussed.
